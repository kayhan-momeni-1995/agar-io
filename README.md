# agar-io

This mini-game that I developed for my advanced programming course project is my trial of implementing a game similar to [https://agar.io/](https://agar.io/).


Upun running this repository, one user must run the game as the ”server,” and others could join the server as clients.

Clients can search for available servers over a local network, connect to a particular server, sign up/login, and wait for the server to start the game. Each player is represented by a circle that has a size proportional to its mass. The goal is to ”eat” as many smaller circles as possible and avoid larger circles. Besides, multiple power-ups randomly appear on the screen; each power-up has a particular feature and should be ”eaten” by a player.
